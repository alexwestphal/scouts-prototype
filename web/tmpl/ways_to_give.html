    <h4>Become a Monthly Donor</h4>
    <p>
        A monthly donation is one of the best ways to support Scouts New Zealand and our mission. Monthly donations help
        us to plan funding efficiently and is very cost effective. For as little as 1$ a day you can bring the joys of
        Scouting to children and youth throughout New Zealand. Your donation will be processed on the 15th of every
        month and you will receive a consolidated tax receipt for your combined annual gifts each January.

    <h4>Recognize a Leader and Local Hero</h4>
    <p>
        Has a leader made a difference in the life of your child? What a great way to say thank you to his or her leader
        by making a special gift in recognition of their hard work. We will send a card to the leader being recognized
        to acknowledge their dedication and hard work. <a href="#">Click here to nominate a Local Hero today.</a>

    <h4>Continue your Legacy</h4>
    <p>
        Your legacy can help to provide a place where kids can be themselves, can learn new skills, and grow into
        healthy functional members of society. Leaving a charitable gift in your Will is one way you can ensure that
        the principles that matter most to you are upheld after you are gone.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are many ways to give a planned gift, through your Will and bequests, securities, trusts, bonds and
        annuities. You can even leave personal property or real estate. Please let us know if you name Scouts New
        Zealand in your estate plans. By letting us know ahead of time, we can make sure your gift is used in the way
        you wish it to be used, including the possibility of establishing an endowment fund in your name.
