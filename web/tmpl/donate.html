    <h3>Why Scouts New Zealand</h3>
    <p>
        As the nations leading youth serving organization, Scouts New Yealand provides children and youth (ages 5 - 26)
        an opportunity to be themselves, learn new skills, and grow into healthy functional members of society. Through
        our programs young people discover the best in themselves and the best in each other.

        For the youth who experience Scouts New Zealand programs, it is an amazing time and a life-changing adventure.
        Your support allows us to support youth from all across New Zealand, from within your own communities, to help
        them reach their full potential as good citizens for tomorrow.  It starts with Scouts!
