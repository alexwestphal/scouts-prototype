    <h4>Where Do My Registration Fees Go?</h4>
    <p>
        For the 2013 Scouting year, $92.50 of the total registration fee goes to the Scouts New Zealand National Office to
        cover the cost of:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Training materials and resources for leaders</li>
        <li>Planning programs and activities for youth (these must be planned meticulously to ensure compliance with insurance and health standards)</li>
        <li>Publications and handbooks</li>
        <li>Providing service and support to 38 zones across New Zealand</li>
        <li>Volunteer servicing expenses</li>
        <li>World Scouting fee</li>
        <li>Risk Management</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The remainder of the fee is levied by your local zone. Each zone is different, and in fact, fees differ from
        group to group. Your zone may need fees to provide service, support and programs to the groups and areas within
        their jurisdiction. Your zone takes into consideration these costs, and calculates their fee based on the lowest
        possible amount necessary to cover all costs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dollar for dollar, Scouts New Zealand’s programs provide significant value to its members. Programs run all year
        long and include many adventures such as camping trips that kids will remember for a lifetime. Most importantly,
        Scouting makes a difference in the lives of children, youth and young adults. They are more likely to demonstrate
        greater self-confidence and optimism about what the future holds. They express a strong sense of civic
        responsibility and have a desire to “pay back” the community. They become more physically fit, energetic, outgoing,
        conscientious and compassionate.

    <h4>Does Scouts New Zealand Admit Both Boys and Girls? </h4>
    <p>
        Yes, Scouts New Zealand became completely co-ed in 1978.
    </p>

    <hr/>
    <h4>Do You Have to Believe in God to Join Scouts New Zealand? Is Scouting a Christian Organization? </h4>
    <p>
        No, but you must have a basic spiritual belief. Spirituality has been one of the three main principles of Scouting
        around the world since its inception more than 100 years ago. Scouts New Zealand is proud of its commitment to
        diversity and welcomes members of many different faiths and denominations.

        You need not belong to an organized religion, but all members must take the Scout Promise in good faith and leaders
        may include some form of spirituality in their program for the youth. “God” represents spirituality and for some may
        represent an actual deity, but it may also mean an expression of your personal spirituality.

        "Duty to God" as defined by the World Organization of the Scouting Movement, means "a person's relationship with the
        spiritual values of life, the fundamental belief in a force above mankind."
