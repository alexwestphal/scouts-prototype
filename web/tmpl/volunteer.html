    <h4>What does Scouting do for youth?</h4>
    <p>
        Scouting volunteers have provided generations of New Zealand youth with a first opportunity to sleep in a tent,
        to experience leadership and to build self-reliance and self-confidence. Volunteer dedication, resourcefulness
        and enthusiasm are vital to Scouting.
    </p>

    <h4>Why is Scouting a great volunteer experience?</h4>

    <h4>How do I volunteer with Scouts New Zealand?</h4>
    <p>
        Becoming a volunteer with Scouts New Zealand is a multi-step process and we are here to help you every step of
        the way. The process includes a personal interview, the provision of two personal references, and a Police
        Record Check. With one-on-one help from experienced leaders, you'll participate in a three-month orientation
        and probation period where you'll learn all the basics to help you provide great programs for youth.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you become a leader, you're provided with further training and tools and support to help you on your way.
        You'll attend courses and workshops and can access helpful online support resources.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you can commit 12 - 14 hours per month, you can make a difference in the lives of many kids, and help shape
        a better world for tomorrow.
