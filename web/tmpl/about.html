    <blockquote id="promise">
        <div>Scouts have fun adventures</div>
        <div>discovering new things and experiences</div>
        <div>they wouldn’t discover elsewhere.</div>
        <div>Along the way they develop into capable,</div>
        <div>confident and well-rounded individuals,</div>
        <div>better prepared for success in the world.</div>
        <div>Scouts is the start of something great.</div>
        <div><strong>It starts with Scouts.</strong></div>
