        <b>Scouting makes a difference.</b> Providing opportunities for youth to grow, experience new "firsts" and
        develop into citizens of the world.

        Scouts demonstrate self-confidence and optimism. They express a strong sense of civic responsibility and have a
        desire to give back to the community. They become more physically fit, energetic, outgoing, conscientious and
        compassionate. Plus they have a lot of fun!

        But why let kids have all the fun? Scouts New Zealand relies on its network of more than 3,000 caring and
        dedicated volunteers to deliver its programming to youth. And there is always room for more.

        challenging programs, looking to find a rewarding volunteering experience or both, you have found the right
        place.
